      What your BMI result means
    </h2>
    <p class="body-m text-balance text-dark-electric-blue">
      A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining
      a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues
      later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet
      with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and
      vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally
      about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.
